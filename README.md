# Minidump Viewer

⚠️ **Beta**: This project is currently in beta. Expect some rough edges and please report any issues you encounter!


Ever had a crash dump file and wished you could peek inside without installing heavy debugging tools?


That's exactly what this project does! Simply drag and drop your `.dmp` or `.mdmp` files right into your browser and explore what happened during the crash.  And best of all, everything happens locally in your browser - your crash dumps never leave your machine, so your data stays private and secure.
